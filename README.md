# Twitchboard
Social connection dashboard app for Windows 10 centered around Twitter. The name is a derivative of "Twitter Switchboard".

## Features
* Show 3 Twitter feeds in 3 respective columns: My Home Feed, My Timeline, Custom Query
* Hamburger Menu (currently not hooked to any features)

## Implementation Notes
* Twitchboard is built in C# as a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app. The current implementation doesn't support an effective design for Windows 10 Mobile devices. It is currently designed to work in Landscape screen orientation.
* Twitchboard uses controls and services found in the [UWP Community Toolkit](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp-community-toolkit).
